Issue 1  

Problem: Username/nickname did not check for uniqueness. This allows users to create username/nickname that were the same.  

Steps: Under Class UserService I changed the create class method. The changes made was a separation of concerns between checking the email and username/nickname uniqueness. It also generates one if user does not provide while ensuring it is not taken. I included two new classes called EmailAlreadyExistsException and NicknameAlreadyExistsException. I included these new exceptions in the routers file. I added testing to the behavior of checking username/nickname uniqueness was passing.  

Outcome: With these new changes, the program ensures that users are creating or generates a username/nickname that is unique and cannot be used by others.

Issue 2  

Problem: Password was missing some additional. For instance, checks for length or symbols.  

Steps: In the user_schemas file, I added these missing checks in the class UserCreate(UserBase). Additionally, I had errors running saying I was on pydantic v2 so i had to adjust the code to be recognized by it. I included testings to verify the behaviors of the checks were running correctly. Alongside checking the behavior, I also checked the errors were also outputting correcty.  

Outcome: These new changes allow for a more secure password that checks and include these complex changes. This enchances the users security.
